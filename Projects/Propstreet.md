intro: Eager to employ my skills within UX design, I got in contact with Propstreet, a startup in Stockholm. They had launched a marketplace for commercial real estate half a year earlier and wanted to take both functionality and UX to the next level. I became responsible for translating these ambitions to a fully functional website thoroughly based on user feedback.
responsibilities: UX, Graphic design

## From Cannes to www
Most commercial real estate transactions are made between people who have met each other face to face. These transactions often involve sensitive details and brokers want to know that investors have real investing interests. Until now, the solution has been analogue meetings to ensure trust, where one of the more popular ones is an event in Cannes. Propstreet introduces a digital marketplace that respects the rules of confidentiality in commercial real estate transactions and provides brokers with new contacts.

## Developing feasible, user-oriented functions
User data was collected through both interviews and user feedback. Based on this, new functionality was developed together with the Propstreet team. Ideation sessions where I built wireframes on both paper and digital were held iteratively during two weeks. Feedback was implemented on wireframes and new versions were built. A close dialogue with the development team was held to ensure feasibility.

## Providing system understanding

There are few comparable services to Propstreet since it is something between a marketplace and a social network. This creates special demands on how the system understanding is communicated to the user. A new logged in landing page was created to convey how the system works. An onboarding was created in two versions, one for brokers and one for investors.
