title: Authority communications
company: MSB
order: "2"
coverImage: './images/msb/vision.jpg'
intro: MSB has been commissioned by the government to coordinate authority communication during society impacting events. Through user research with communication officers from multiple authorities, participation in crisis exercises and a close dialogue with the internal communications coordinators at MSB, an entirely new communications tool was created. I was involved from strategies and user journeys to high definition prototypes.
responsibilities: Strategy, UX/UI

## Waking up quickly
MSB handles crises, but as they don’t happen too often, they mostly work preventively. But when a crisis occurs, they need to get going quickly. Training for when major events occur is hard, and many tools are not even used when people are stressed.

## Taking advantage of the situation
There was a tool already in use, but on a very old platform. At the beginning, MSB wanted to move their current application to anew platform with only minor updates. We wanted to see if there were more than only visual improvements that were needed for this tool to get accepted and used. I got involved and started user research.

## ”It just has to work, but we might not train with it”
Meeting with communications officers at different major authorities revealed that they often don’t have time to engage with tools not in use in their daily work. Therefore they have set their own routines for crisis communications. The tool from MSB was deemed too old to use and not interesting enough, many times Excel was used instead.

## What can we do?
We updated the product visually of course, but also focused on putting the harder tasks out of sight for seldom users. As the majority of users in other authorities will log in with a very low frequency, it needs to be easy to log in, and once inside, they need to be able to grasp the interface instantly. The major user tasks were mapped out and were refined and user tested. The final product was released just before the Corona crisis.
