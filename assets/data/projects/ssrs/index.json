This jetski has been successfully used for shallow water rescue and rescue missions where quickness and agility is necessary. It is easily manoeuvred by one person and can handle very rough conditions. For this jetski, a lifting cradle was developed which you can drive into and then be quickly and safely be lifted. My challenge was to learn from the old cradles and design a new one for their newly developed jetski of a bigger size.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solving-the-puzzle\"><a href=\"#solving-the-puzzle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solving the Puzzle</h2>\n<h1 id=\"ssrs\"><a href=\"#ssrs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>SSRS</h1>\n<h1 id=\"min-första-md\"><a href=\"#min-f%C3%B6rsta-md\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Min första MD</h1>\n<p>Hallihallå</p>\n<p><em>kursiv</em> <strong>fet</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ett</li>\n<li>två</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"context":{}}
