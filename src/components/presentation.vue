      <p>
        I am a curious and questioning designer who loves to challenge norms. So far this has resulted in that I have crushed the stigma surrounding hearing aids, that I have helped making the sea rescue society autonomously airborne and that I have created a service for commercial real estate brokers so that they donâ€™t have to go to Cannes to find new investors.
        I am driven by making the world more kind and have a deep belief in the dialogue. I am at my best when I am part of a high valued design process.
